HTML CSS SCSS Project Login Registration

first project made.

created only with html, css and scss. No other languages were allowed.

Task was to create a functioning registration form with the things we have learend so far. 

We experimented with some stuff we hadn't used before, such as 'target'

We tried to use 'target' to access the element that we need.



p.s. the background color of the project, as well as from the registration form changes or is not available when viewed with github BitBucket
